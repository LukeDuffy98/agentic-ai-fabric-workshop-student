# Contoso Support — On-call policy (training sample)

This document is a synthetic training sample for a lab.

## Policy rules

1. **Shift length**: On-call shifts are **4 hours**.
2. **Fairness**: Each team member should cover the same number of shifts (when possible).
3. **Avoid Fridays (limited)**: Do not schedule on-call shifts on **Friday 12:00–20:00**.
4. **Escalation window**: If a schedule includes **Monday 08:00–12:00**, assign it to the most experienced team member.

## Team context (training sample)

- **Alex** is the most experienced team member.

## Notes

- If a request conflicts with these rules, ask a clarifying question or propose the smallest change needed.
